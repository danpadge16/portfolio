# portfolio

The Homework for the second week of the coding bootcamp was to create a portfolio page using html and advanced css methods.

Both the CSS and HTML files have been commented to highlight what has been created.

I found this task incredibly difficult and unfortunately have not created something that is the finished article.

Below is a screenshot of the webpage.
